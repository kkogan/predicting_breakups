		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> <p>How Couples Meet and Stay Together (HCMST) surveyed how Americans met their spouses and romantic partners, and compared traditional to non-traditional couples. This collection covers data that was gathered over five waves. During the first wave, respondents were asked about their relationship status, including the gender, ethnicity, and race of their current partner, as well as the level of education of their parents. They were also asked about their living arrangements with their partner, the country, state, and city the respondent and/or the respondent's partner resided in most from birth to age 16, and whether the couple attended the same high school/college/university, or grew up in the same town. Information was collected on the legal status of the relationship, the city/state where the partnership was legalized, and how many times the respondent had previously been married. Additionally, respondents were asked about how often they visited with relatives, which gender they were most attracted to, their earned income in 2008, and the length of their current relationship. Finally, respondents were asked to recall how, when, and where they met their partner, how their parents felt about their partner, and to describe the perceived quality of their relationship. The second wave followed up with respondents one year after Wave 1. Information was collected on respondents' changes, if any, in marital status, relationship status, living arrangements, and reasons for separation where applicable. The third wave followed up with respondents one year after the second wave, and collected information on respondents' relationships reported in the first two waves, again including any changes in the status of the relationship and reasons for separation. The fourth wave followed up with respondents two years after Wave 3. In addition to information on relationship status and reasons for separation, Wave 4 includes the subjective level of attractiveness for the respondent and their partner. Wave 5 collected updated data on respondents' changes, if any, in marital status, relationship status, and reasons for separation where applicable. Information about respondents' sexual orientations, sex frequencies, and attitudes towards sexual monogamy were also collected. Demographic information includes age, race/ethnicity, gender, level of education, household composition, religion, political party affiliation, and household income.</p>
<p>The data is being released in two parts: part one is available for public use and part two is available for restricted use. The public use data contains Waves 1-5, including the addition of nine variables collecting information such as race, household income, whether the respondent was born outside of the United States, zip code relative to rural area, and respondents' living arrangements between birth and 16 years of age. The restricted use data contains Waves 1-3, and differs from the public use data by including FIPS codes for state of marriage and state of residence, town or city where the respondent was raised, and qualitative variables revised by the Principal Investigator (Waves 1-5), consisting of respondent's answers to how they first met their partner, the quality of their relationship in their own words, why they broke up if applicable and if they have an open relationship.</p></span></p>

		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Study Design:</strong> The survey was carried out by survey firm Knowledge Networks. The survey respondents were recruited from an ongoing panel. Panelists are recruited via random digit dial phone survey. Survey questions were mostly answered online; some follow-up surveys were conducted by phone. Panelists who did not have internet access at home were given an internet access device (WebTV). For further information about how the Knowledge Networks hybrid phone-internet survey compares to other survey methodology, see the accompanying documentation.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> There were 4,002 original survey respondents from members of Knowledge Network's Nationally Representative Survey Panel. Subsequent waves included the 3,009 survey respondents who were partnered at the time of the main survey, minus the respondents who reported having broken up with their partner or the partner passed away by each previous wave. Please see the "Brief Guide to data sources and variables in the public HCMST" within the ICPSR codebook for further information.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Time Method:</strong> Longitudinal: Panel</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Universe:</strong> The Universe for Wave 1 was English literate adults in the US. The Universe for Wave 2-5 was respondents who were still together with their partners from Wave 1. Additionally, background information was collected on all subjects who remained in the Knowledge Networks/ GfK panel.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Unit(s) of Observation:</strong> Individual</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Method of Data Collection:</strong> survey data</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Mode of Data Collection:</strong> computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI), web-based survey</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Response Rates:</strong> Response to Wave 1 (main survey) was 71 percent. Response to Wave 2 (follow-up survey) one year later was 84 percent. Response to Wave 3 (follow-up survey) one year later was 72.9 percent. Response to Wave 4 (follow-up survey) was 60 percent. Response rate to Wave 5 (follow-up survey) was 46%</span></p>
